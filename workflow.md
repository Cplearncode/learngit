Hi

git init to create local repo
git status - to see withich files are tracked, - to get tracked use git add file name
(write some letter and click tab to auto fill)

after git add comment if u do changes it won't reflect (add used to apply changes)
for git commit local , inital we need to config user name and user email (ex.git config --global user.name "")
can see config file using  - git config --global -e

git remote add orgin and to check git remote -v

by default local rep has branch master, where remote is main, so i think  upstream is nee.
to set remote url name can be anything.. but have to use it carefully when push the codee


pwd to see current directory
To toggle the terminal panel, use the Ctrl+`

create gitignore file with no extension and write file name in that to ignore

create branch using branch <name>

to merge local use merge <branch-name> if from remote use origin/<branch-name>
